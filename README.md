## About Coder Projects
Coder Projects are [Coder](http://goo.gl/coder) apps and instructional step-by-step guides designed to get new programmers excited about making things with code. They range from introductory lessons on the basic web stuff Coder utilizes (HTML, CSS, Javascript) to more complex projects that show what code can do.

Coder Projects are perfect for anyone new to coding, or helping someone else learn. Each project is designed to be a jumping off point that will leave you with something fun and hopefully give you ideas for projects of your own.

## want to Contribute to Coder Projects?
If you have an interesting project made with Coder, and you think would help and inspire others, create a project and let us know about it. You'll find a template for creating a Coder Project in the template folder on the master branch.
